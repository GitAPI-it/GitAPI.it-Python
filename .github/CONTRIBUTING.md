Welcome to our contributing guide! If you plan to contribute, this is where you need to be! It's very simple to contribute, but some rules need to be followed before you start! Let's get into them!

To start contributing, please clone the repo:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/darkdarcool/GitData-Typescript
```
Once you have cloned it, you need to install the following dependencies:

``` bash 
npm install
```
Once the dependencies are installed, you can edit to your hearts content until your means are met! When you are done editing, please run:

``` bash
npm run build
```
To build it, and then run:

```
npm run dist
```

To check the Javascript code for errors. If there is an error, ***DO NOT MAKE THE PULL REQUEST***, make sure to fix those errors before submitting the pull request.

Then, when your code is bug and error free, please open `main.test.js`, and describe a testcase, and make test cases for everything you want to happen, on _all_ data. 

_All_ of your tests must past to be submitted, and make sure to double check and make sure that the data is correct!

Once all of that is done, you can then submit the pull request for review! And if we think it should be added, it will the merged! And your pull request will be complete!
